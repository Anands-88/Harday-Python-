print("""For these next few excercises, you will have exact same drills
1. Go back through and write a commcent on what each line does
2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors
3. From now on, when you mistakes,write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake
   you made.
4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make
   them in this new one.
5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone
   into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but itâ€™s all an act. They make mistakes all the
   time.""")
